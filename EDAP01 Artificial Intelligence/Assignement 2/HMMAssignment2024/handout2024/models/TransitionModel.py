# The transition model contains the transition matrix and some methods for convenience,
# including transposition
#
# The transition probabilities follow the rules given in the description:
#
# P( h_t+1 = h_t | not encountering a wall) = 0.7
# P( h_t+1 != h_t | not encountering a wall) = 0.3
# P( h_t+1 = h_t | encountering a wall) = 0.0
# P( h_t+1 != h_t | encountering a wall) = 1.0
#
# where it should always be assumed that the 'robot' first finds out how to turn (or not)
# and then makes an actual step in that new direction, this is then considered a move (or step).
