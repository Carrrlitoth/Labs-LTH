# This is the observation model for the sensor with non-uniform failure probability
# 
# The observation model contains the diagonals (stored as vectors) of the observation
# matrices for each possible sensor reading r
# The last of these vectors contains the probabilities for the sensor to produce nothing ("None")
#
# The implementation follows the description as follows
# 
# the probability for
# - reporting reading r when in any of the four states (poses) i belonging to position "r" is 0.1
# - reporting r when actually in any of the four states (poses) i belonging to any of the 
#    n_Ls ∈ {3, 5, 8} existing surrounding fields Ls of r is 0.05 
# - reporting r when actually in any of the four states (poses) i belonging to any of the 
#    n_Ls2 ∈ {5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16} existing “secondary” surrounding fields Ls2 of r is 0.025 
# - reporting "nothing" (None) is 1.0 - 0.1 - n_Ls*0.05 - n_Ls2*0.025 for ALL states i
